## Workshop Overview

This workshop focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP)- ie. how can we make a computer "understand" human text / speech, and how can we get a computer to write (generate) text / speech.

There will be four different sections exploring different visualizations, techniques and tools:

- Word clouds to see visualize what are the most frequently used words / what everyone is saying
- Word clusters to understand what words "go with" other words
- Sentiment Analysis to understand the polarity of phrases (ie. if it is a positive of negative sentiment)
- Generating your own Shakespeare Play


## Intended Audience

The main notebooks for this workshop is for people who have some basic knowledge of Python and would like to learn more about, or start a career in, data science.

However, if you have not worked with Python or Jupyter notebooks before, we also have two notebooks covering that.


## Installation and Setup Instructions

In order to setup the environment and run the workshop material, you'll need to:

- Install Python and relevant libraries on your machine. We recommend downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
